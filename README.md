### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jake, but I commonly go by the name Deftioon online.
- British-Born Chinese
- High School 2nd year, 16 yrs old, taking the IBDP course.
- Interested in Mathematics and Computer Science.
- Invested in anything matrices. Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, Graph Theory, and Quantum Computing.

I am currently learning [Mojo](https://github.com/modularml/mojo) because I think its fun and has potential, and Rust for more general-purpose things.

I'm currently working on [Quojo](https://github.com/Deftioon/Quojo), a Qiskit-like framework for simulating and working with Quantum Computing concepts, as a way to enhance my learning in the field of Quantum Computing.

I'm also wrapping my head around [this ML project](https://github.com/Deftioon/Deftioon-Mojo) I'm working on to be a fully-functioning neural networking library constructed from scratch.

You can reach me through Discord I guess... `deftioon` is the username.
